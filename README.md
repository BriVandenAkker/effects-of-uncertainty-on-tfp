Social Infrastructure is the set of institutions and policies that determine the environment in which goods and services are produced within a country. When levels of uncertainty within a country change, policies and institutions are expected to adapt to that new environment. This paper uses foreign and domestic shocks as instruments for uncertainty as measured by bond/stock returns and volatility which are regressed on an approximate measure of short term growth in social infrastructure. Results are mixed which suggests some causal relationship between rising uncertainty as expressed in bond yields and volatility and short term changes to social infrastructure, while these results are not robust and fail to replicate when omitting certain instruments and when using stock market data as a proxy for uncertainty.

3. Data

	The data used in this paper are obtained from several sources. Average years of schooling are taken from the United Nations Human Development Report, Capital stock estimates are taken from the International Monetary Fund,  and labor force statistics are taken from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Natural Disaster data is taken from the Geological and Meteorological Events Database (GeoMet) constructed by Felbermayr and Gröschl (Felbermayr & Gröschl, 2013). Lastly, the four main instruments: (1) Political shocks,  (2) Revolutions, (3) Natural Disaster shocks, and (4) Terrorist shocks are constructed by Baker and Bloom as well as the proxies for uncertainty as measured by stock and bond market levels/volatility (Baker & Bloom, 2013). 


5. Results

	In Column 1 and 2 of Table 1 we can see the results of Bloom and Baker’s regressions on the GDP growth. The first column is a simple OLS regression of stock market returns and volatility levels on growth and the second is a 2SLS with the shocks data used for instruments. Interestingly, despite their claims for robust results I find that their results are no longer significant with my smaller subset of 28 countries. 
	The first-stage of all the regressions ran in Table1 show the political shocks to be highly significant and positive for both stock returns and volatility measurements, while the effects of political shocks on volatility are shown to be greater than the effects on levels of return. It’s interesting to notice that political shocks are shown to actually increase stock returns which might indicate the assasinations, wars, and coups associated with these shocks were benefitial, at least in the short term, though might have been harmful after the initial impact as we do see subsequent increases in volatility. 
	The second-stage does not show any significant effects on the dependent variables. I find that changes in uncertainty as proxied by stock market returns and volatility do not have significant effects on short-term growth in social infrastructure as shown in columns 3 and 4 or in levels of investment as shown by the growth in capital stock in columns 5 and 6. 
	The instruments and dependent variables used in Table 2 are identical to those used in Table 1. What differs is the proxy for uncertainty. Here I apply bond market yields and volatility as measures for uncertainty and use the shocks and interaction term for natural disaster severity as instruments. The first-stage results show significant negative effects for the interaction term suggesting that the combination of unexpected shocks and severity decrease bond yields while increasing (though with lower significance ~90 percent) volatility. 
	The second-stage results show that bond yields effect on social infrastructure and investment are statistically significant when the interaction term for natural disasters are included in the model. Although we see the effects on investment are near zero while the those on social infrastructure are higher and positive which suggests that when uncertainty increases, as measured through bond yields, social infrastructure actually grows. Column 4 also finds slightly signficant and negative results for bond volatility measures on social infrastructure which suggests lasting changes to the level of uncertainty actually reduces social infrastructure within a country. 
	Earlier we saw evidence suggesting that TFP growth was highly volatile over the 1970’s and 1980’s compared to growth in capital stocks and labor forces. This variation seems like it could explain the similarly large variation in national output across decades for most countries. From a larger set of 142 countries I find cross decade variation to decline in more recent decades with correlations between 0.25 and 0.45 for the 1990’s to the 2010’s. For a smaller sample, I find TFP variation in growth remains high where cross decade correlations are low around 0.1 and and is much higher for growth in the capital stock (around 0.6). Figures 1, 2, and 3 also show how the variation in cross-decade growth in output, TFP, and capital stocks have evolved within the sample. These findings suggest that despite lower variation in recent cross-decade growth we do see high variation in TFP growth which is where most of the output variation should come from. 
	Therefore, explaining the causal forces effecting the variation in TFP is important if we want to understand why growth rates are so inconsistent through time. From the regression in column 4 in Table 2 we do see evidence suggesting unexpected events have a positive effect for initial yield levels while there is a negative effect for longer term increases in the level of uncertainty. It’s also important to acknowledge that these results are not robust. Similar regressions do not yield the same results and show largely insignificant results, which is also true for the models used in Baker and Blooms paper. This could be a result of several weaknesses in this papers data and methodology. 
	First, the sample size is small and is not representative of most of the developing countries throughout the world which we might expect would have higher vulnerabilities to these shocks. The average income per capita from the sample in 2010 was $21,000 while the world average at that time was $9,525. The results of this paper suggest that these richer nations are not heavily effected by changes in uncertainty. 
	Second, there could be omitted variables that would capture more of the variation in our proxies for uncertainty which would improve the explanatory power of the model. Using bond and stock data also only loosely traces what we’re calling uncertainty. Certain communities within a country could experience substantial increases in economic uncertainty while debt and equity investors might see no reason for these poorer conditions in those areas to effect their investment portfolio. This would fail to capture much of the true uncertainty in a country, especially if most companies are not listed on public stock exchanges. 
	Lastly, we can expect most changes in social infrastructure to have a lag greater than one year. Only considering the short-term effects therefore fails to capture all of the true effects that we’d expect to occur over a longer time period. Finding better instruments which can consider the long-term effects of uncertianty on economic growth and social infrastructure would provide value to the current literature on uncertainty.
